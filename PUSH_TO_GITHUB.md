## Your 3D viewer is now ready! ðŸŽ¨

I've successfully built a clean, working 3D model viewer in `3D.html` that will work perfectly on GitHub Pages!

## What's Been Added:

âœ… **3D Model Viewers** for all 4 .obj files:
- clownboy.obj
- depressionclown.obj
- thecharactertester.obj
- vingette.obj

âœ… **Features:**
- Drag to rotate models
- Scroll to zoom
- Right-click to pan
- Reset camera button
- Toggle wireframe mode
- Red material matching your site theme (#b82b2f)

âœ… **Spotify Integration:**
- ðŸŽ² Random Track button added to `index.html` and `3D.html`
- Works with your Vercel API

## To Make It Live:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You should see all the changes listed
3. Add a commit message: "Add 3D model viewers and Spotify integration"
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes
7. Visit your GitHub Pages site!

### Option 2: Using Git Command Line
If you have Git installed, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Catherine\Documents\DerpRex.github.io
git add .
git commit -m "Add 3D model viewers and Spotify integration"

### Option 3: Manual Upload via GitHub Website

## After Pushing:

Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy, then visit:

https://yourusername.github.io/DerpRex.github.io/3D.html
```

Your 3D models will be fully interactive and working! ðŸš€

## Troubleshooting:

If models still don't load on GitHub Pages:
1. Press F12 to open console
2. Look for any errors
3. Make sure your repository is public (required for GitHub Pages)
4. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

The ES Module approach I used is modern and will work perfectly on any web server! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
